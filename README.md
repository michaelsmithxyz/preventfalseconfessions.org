# Prevent False Confessions

This is the source respository for
[Prevent False Confessions](https://preventfalseconfessions.org), which was
created by an 8th grade class at the Richard J. Murphy K-8 School in Dorchester, Massachusetts, working in the Spring of 2019 with
[Generation Citizen](https://generationcitizen.org), facilitated by
[Sarah Bernt](http://sarahbernt.com) and
[Michael Smith](https://michaelsmith.xyz).

## Generation Citizen

Generation Citizen is a non-profit organization which sends college
volunteers (Democracy Coaches) into schools nationwide to teach an action
civics curriculum. GC believes that the best way to learn about civics and 
promote youth civic engagement is to show young people how to exercise their 
ability to be active and engaged citizens in our democracy.

Over the course of a semester, students debate and build consensus around
an issue in that community which they would like to help address. After
selecting an issue, they do research to identify root causes of the issue, and
ultimately develop a plan to perform real advocacy relating to their issue
on the state and/or local level.

## Prevent False Confessions

Over the course of the Spring 2019 semester, our class at the Murphy School
developed a project centered around addressing the issue of police
brutality, which they see as a problem in their community. They ultimately
settled on a lack of police accountability as a root cause of this issue. To
address this, they decided to support
[Massachusetts Bill HR.1540](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/H1540) which
would mandate that most custodial interrogations performed by police officers
be filmed in an effort to prevent false or forced confessions.

As part of a larger advocacy plan to support this bill, they designed a layout
and wrote text for this website, which will be used to host an informational
video and petition that the class also made to advocate for the bill. This
site is hosted at
